						<h2>About</h2>
						<p>
							Knowing that help is available motivates you to workout, and ensures that your squats and bench presses are done safely in good form. It also increases commitment as credit card information is taken, and if you bail on a workout without a notice of cancellation, you will be charged a base fee for wasting the trainer's time.

							In a perfect world, you would have a constant workout buddy who would also be a personal trainer with years of experience, and who could show you the perfect form, and spot your workouts. However, this world is lacking, and I am trying to correct some of this imperfection with this app.
						</p>
						<h2>My approach to it</h2>
						<p>
							This was an extension of my final project for Bitmaker Labs. A friend of mine was looking for partners to spot him at the gym, and thus the idea was born.

							It is an app that is similar to Uber, in that it allows you to find gym trainers or gym assistance wherever you are. For example, if I happen to be in an unfamiliar city tonight and have an hour to kill, I can look for an available trainer/assistant on this app and make a booking for a specific time.

							A credit card will be needed for users to start using the service, so they will be charged if they are a no show.
						</p>

							<h3>Challenges</h3>
							<p>
								I had initially planned for payment to be done on the site (with Stripe or Amazon Payments) as well, but it was tricky to put an fee on non-certified gym assistance, so I eventually decided for the users to discuss it with the trainers themselves. There is now the added issue of trying to differentiate between the certified trainer, who are able to charge more for their services, and the non-certified help. I also want credit card verification of the user to be done to decrease the chances of last minute cancellations or no-shows, but this would limit the service to only users who have credit cards.

								I am also working on this alone, and it is taking a longer time for me to figure out my mistakes and debug any errors. On the upside, I am learning a lot more.
							</p>
						</div>
						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>
							After asking for feedback on this, I have realized that there does seem to be a need for such an app/service, and I would like to look into it further should time permit.

							PS. This app is not fully complete and work on it will be picked up again in 2015.
